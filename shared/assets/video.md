# Video Replay and Camera Multicasting

Note: This is an optional module.

This module provides two companion applications for OWLCMS competitions:
- **Cameras** — multicasting of camera feeds to multiple displays
- **Replays** — video replay management for jury review
#####
Both applications are installed and updated together as a single version.
Each version directory contains both the `cameras` and `replays` binaries.
