# Cameras

Note: This is an optional module.


#####

This module installs the **Cameras** application for multicasting camera feeds.
- **Cameras** sends compressed H.264 video over the network where it can be used by OBS, vMix and the Replays module
- **Cameras** autodetects the devices connected to the computer (it ignores the built-in cameras by default)
- If Replays and the Cameras are on the same computer and you don't want to send video over the network, you can select the "local only" option to prevent sending the streams on the network.

#####

You can install **Cameras** by itself, it does not require **Replays** to be installed.
You can run cameras on one machine and replays on another.
